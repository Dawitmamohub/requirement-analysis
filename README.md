# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction
This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis phase** of a booking management system.  
The goal is to demonstrate how requirements are gathered, analyzed, structured, and represented to provide a strong foundation for software development.  
By following the tasks, we simulate a **real-world scenario** where clarity, precision, and structure are key to successful project execution.

## 🔎 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of **identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations** of stakeholders in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  

It ensures that:  
- The development team understands exactly what the client requires.  
- Requirements are translated into clear, structured documentation.  
- A roadmap is created that guides the design, development, and testing phases.  

In short, Requirement Analysis is the **cornerstone of successful software development**, reducing risks and ensuring business goals are met.

## ⭐ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical because it:  

1. **Prevents Misunderstandings**  
   Ensures all stakeholders share the same understanding of the project scope.  

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   Detecting issues early avoids expensive fixes later in the development cycle.  

3. **Provides a Clear Roadmap**  
   Acts as a blueprint that guides developers, testers, and project managers.

## 📋 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The main activities involved in Requirement Analysis include:  

- **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting initial needs from stakeholders.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** – Refining and clarifying requirements through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Documentation** – Creating structured documents (SRS, use cases, diagrams).  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** – Studying feasibility, prioritizing, and representing requirements visually.  
- **Requirement Validation** – Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

### ✅ Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**.  
For the Booking Management System, examples include:  
- Users can create, view, update, and cancel bookings.  
- The system allows secure payment processing.  
- Admin can generate booking reports.  
- Users receive confirmation emails after successful booking.  

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**.  
Examples include:  
- The system must handle up to 5,000 concurrent users.  
- Payment transactions should be processed within 2 seconds.  
- The system should comply with GDPR data protection standards.  
- The platform should be accessible via mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🎭 Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams illustrate the **interactions between system actors and system functionality**.  
They help visualize system scope and clarify roles of users and external entities.  

### Textual Representation (ASCII Diagram)
For a quick overview, here is a textual representation of the booking system's use cases:
